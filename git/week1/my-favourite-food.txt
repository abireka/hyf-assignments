Shorshe Ilish

Hilsa Fish in a Mustard Gravy
Serves: 4-6

Preparing the Mustard Paste

White Mustard - 2 tbsp

Black Mustard - 1 tbsp

Salt - 1 tsp

Green Chilies - 3

Warm Water - ¼ cup

Sugar - just a pinch

Soak all the ingredients in warm water for 30 minutes. Place them in a blender and grind till a smooth paste is formed. The finished paste should be a creamy yellow color with black and green flecks. Try to make this paste right before cooking and not earlier. The sharpness and bitterness of mustard increases while sitting so don’t make this ahead of time or store for more than a day or two. If you have extra mustard paste, the best way to store it is by freezing it right away.

Preparing the Fish

Ilish (Hilsa) - 4-6 pieces - bone in steaks cut into 2-3 inches wide

Turmeric - 1 tsp

Salt - 1 tsp

Mustard Oil - 1-2 tsp

Ilish is a very delicate fish so be gentle while cleaning and preparing it. Descale, wash and pat dry the fish. Mix the turmeric and salt in mustard oil. Rub the fish on both sides with the oil mix and set it aside for 30 minutes.
