The Sad Banana
There lived a banana sad as can be.

Stuck inside with no glee.

Wishing they could be free.


So one day they decided to write a poem so they thought.

They got about three lines written with the last words rhyming before they rethought.

Maybe I don't have it in me to rhyme there's too many words to be sought.


Or maybe I do, those last three ended pretty well.

But no, I've ended with a word I'm sure I'll never rhyme, ah hell.
