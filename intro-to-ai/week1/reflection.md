I think relying too much on AI makes things feel a bit too easy. the code works but I don’t fully understand how or why. For example, if I remove some CSS parts like padding or margin from AI-generated code, there’s often no visible change. so it doesn’t really feel like it’s my project. Another issue is to make the design match what I  thought, I change AI’s code so much that it feels like writing from scratch would be better. the biggest thing is that I don’t feel like I’m really doing anything but asking and somebody is doing my job.

but I also learned a few new things. I got to understand CSS styling a bit better. like  how small changes can affect the layout. I also learned a little about how a button interacts with JavaScript, but honestly I don’t fully get it yet. but I got a better idea of how HTML, CSS and JavaScript work together to make something function.

I added a custom Google Font with a help from a YouTube tutorial. mostly I changed the CSS styling to adjust the look and position of things. But I saw that AI gave me so many different elements and properties that I didn’t really know before. and now I’ve learned a bit more from those.


If I already had a good understanding of coding then Copilot would be really helpful partner. But as mow I’m still learning, I don’t think I should depend on it too much cause I think it will make me lazy instead of figuring things out myself.
